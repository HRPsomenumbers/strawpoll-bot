Script for automatically vote multiply times in the website "strawpoll.me". Easy to use.

How to use it on Windows (for dummies):

1. Download the program GIT if you don't have it. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git, https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download node.js if you don't have it. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js, https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Download the script




First of all, you will need to install the program GIT ( https://git-scm.com/downloads )
Then, create a new folder and place the 2 script files there.
Open GIT (right click, GIT BASH) and write there "npm i request" then "npm i cheerio"

Now you only need a list of proxies ( you can get for free, just do a quick search in google )
Then place it at "socks.json" in the following format: [ ["ip here"], ["another ip here] ]

Now you have only to configurate the line 39: change the website last numbers and choose an option.
Then write NODE INDEX and you're done. It should work.
