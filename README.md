# Strawpoll.me bypass (automatic voting)
Script for automatically vote multiple times in the website "strawpoll.me". Easy to use.
If you have no idea whats a script, npm, github or dependencies you really should look at the end of the page.

## Features
- Automatically vote multiple times;
- Auto proxy scrapper;
- Friendly interface;
- Works with IP check;
- It's fast;
- Does *NOT* work with _CAPTCHA_;

### I plan to add:
- Voting in multiple options poll;
- Voting in strawpoll.com (only works for strawpoll.me for now);
- If you wan't anything you can request it :)
- Fix to ECONNRESET. Im aware of this bug. I'll try changing from request to another library.


## How to use it:
- Download or clone this repository;
- Open it's folder;
- Write node index in your terminal/git
- It will ask you some options;
- Profit !
- Some votes may fail: thats because of the proxy. But overall you'll get about 1000~ votes if you run the script 3 times.
