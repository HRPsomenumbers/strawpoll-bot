# strawpoll-bypass
Script for automatically vote in the website "strawpoll.me" 

HOW TO USE:

First of all, you will need to install the program GIT ( https://git-scm.com/downloads )
Then, create a new folder and place the 2 script files there.
Open GIT (right click, GIT BASH) and write there "npm i request" then "npm i cheerio"

Now you only need a list of proxies ( you can get for free, just do a quick search in google )
Then place it at "socks.json" in the following formant: [ ["ip here"], ["another ip here] ]

Now you have only to configurate the line 39: change the website last numbers and choose an option.
Then write NODE INDEX and you're done. It should work.




*Works with IP check
