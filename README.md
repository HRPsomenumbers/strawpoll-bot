# Strawpoll.me bypass (automatic voting)
Script for automatically vote multiple times in the website "strawpoll.me". Easy to use.
If you have no idea whats a script, npm, github or dependencies you should look at the end of the page.

## Features
- Automatically vote multiple times;
- Auto proxy scrapper;
- Friendly interface;
- Works with IP check;

- Do *NOT* work with _CAPTCHA_;

### I plan to add:
- Voting in multiple options poll;

## How to use it:

- Open it's folder;
- Write node index in your terminal/git
- It will ask you some options;
- Profit !
